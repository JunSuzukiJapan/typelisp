;; `Sexpr` is now an internal type (read/eval/print/`defmacro`/self-hosting

;; builtins (`registry.rs`). The island navigates `Sexpr` with the `sexpr-*`
;; layer and uses `string` methods (`append`/`equal`/`length`) for name work.

;; `symbol->string`/`string->symbol` (`docs/language-design.md` §4.1's

;; than prelude `defun`s: `Sexpr::Sym` wraps the first-class `Symbol` type (not
;; a `string`), so the old `(match s (Sym name) name)` / `(Sym s)` definitions
;; no longer type-check. They bridge the interned `Symbol` handle to/from its
;; textual name directly against the intern table.

;; `unreachable`/`todo` (cl-equivalence-catalog.md §1.2): placeholders for

;; `if-let` used to be hand-rolled `Expr`-producing Rust functions in
;; `Checker::check_list` (`check_while`/`check_dotimes`/`check_dolist`/
;; `check_when`/`check_and_or`/`check_cond`/`check_if_let`), each duplicating
;; logic the *macro* system can express directly, the same way `until`/
;; `while-let`/`case`/`do` already do further down. Moving them to `defmacro`
;; means the checker only ever sees `if`/`match`/`loop`/`break`/`return` as
;; the irreducible control-flow primitives — fewer `Expr` variants for both
;; the tree-walking interpreter and (especially) the LLVM compiler
;; (`src/compile/`) to special-case. Most of the set (`while`/`dotimes`/
;; `dolist`/`when`/`unless`/`cond`/`if-let`) lives further down, right after
;; `append` — `,@` (unquote-splicing) always desugars through a call to
;; `append` (`Checker::check_qq_template`), even when nothing follows the
;; splice in the same list, so any macro using `,@` needs `append` already
;; registered. `and`/`or` are the exception, kept here: `equal` (just below)
;; already calls `and`, so they must be registered before it — and unlike
;; the others, their recursive-descent shape never needs to splice a `&rest`
;; list into a *partially-built* template, only to `cons` one fixed element
;; onto the front of it, which needs no `append` at all.

;; `and`/`or`: a self-recursive macro — each expansion peels off one
;; argument and re-emits a (shorter) `(and ...)`/`(or ...)` call, which the
;; checker re-expands the same way it already re-expands `case`'s `cond`
;; output (`Checker::check_list`'s macro arm recursively re-`check`s its own
;; expansion) — this is the first macro in the prelude whose expansion
;; mentions *itself* by name rather than a different macro, but the
;; mechanism is identical; termination follows from `cdr`/`null` shrinking
;; `args` by one each step. `(quote true)`/`(quote false)` rather than bare
;; `true`/`false`: a macro's `Sexpr`-typed result can only come from a
;; quasiquote template or `(quote ..)` (both go through `value_to_quoted`)
;; — `Checker::check`'s own literal arms (`Value::Bool` etc.) do *not*
;; coerce to `Sexpr` the way bare `()` does (`Value::Empty`'s special-cased
;; `none`/`nil` lookup), so a raw `false` returned directly from a macro
;; body would fail to check against the macro body's `Sexpr`-expected type.
;; Macro bodies navigate their `Sexpr` argument (`args`) through the
;; `sexpr-*` layer (`sexpr-null`/`sexpr-car`/`sexpr-cdr`/`sexpr-cons`), not
;; the user-facing `car`/`cdr`/`cons` (Phase 4 repurposes those to a generic
;; `cons<T,U>` pair) — Symbol/Sexpr redesign Phase 2. The quasiquote/`list`
;; templates still emit ordinary `car`/`cdr`/`if` symbols into the *expansion*

;;
;; The element type `A` is the iterator's associated `Item`, declared via

;; one of the function's own type parameters, inferred at each call site from
;; the predicate/mapping function's argument type and verified against the
;; iterator's real `Item` (`Checker::check_call`'s where-bound validation).
;; This is why they are generic `defun`s, not `defmethod`s: `map`/`foldl`/
;; `foldr` need type variables (`U`/`B`, the mapped element / accumulator)
;; beyond the receiver's, which a method — generic only through its owner's
;; parameters — cannot introduce.

;; operation (`find`/`position`/`count`/`remove-if`) takes a predicate, not an
;; element: `A` carries no `Eq`-style bound, so there is no generic equality —
;; the predicate form mirrors CL's `-if` family. A freshly built result
;; vector is pinned with `the`, since a bare `(Vector::new)` has nothing to
